# ReVibeBackend

## Project Description
ReVibe is an emergent social media application that helps Revature employees connect and "vibe" with their colleagues inside - and outside - of the workplace. Employees can create and customize their profiles, showcasing the professional achievements they'd like to celebrate with their peers via textual and visual posts. They can also encourage and advise their colleagues by "liking" and commenting on various posts as they appear in their curated ReVibe news feeds.
